**👋 Hi there, I'm Chris!**
===========================
I don’t just build—I deconstruct. From the ground up, I tear things down to see what makes them tick, reverse-engineering my way to deeper understanding and innovation.\
From bits to bytes, from instructions to machine code, from object code to executable programs—building the bridge from raw data to functional innovation, one layer at a time.

**⚡My favorite Fun Science Fact**
-----------------------

### 🔥 **The Hottest Thing in the Universe: Quark-Gluon Plasma**

📍 **Created in the Large Hadron Collider (LHC)**\
🌡 **5.5 Trillion K** -- 350,000x hotter than the Sun's core!\
⚛️ **So hot it melts protons & neutrons like butter in a furnace!**

### ❄️ **The Coldest Thing in the Universe: NASA's Cold Atom Lab**

📍 **Aboard the International Space Station (ISS)**\
🌡 **100 nanoKelvin** -- just a fraction above absolute zero!\
🧊 **AAt 100 nanoKelvin, atoms move so slowly that it would take them nearly 2 seconds to travel just one centimeter—thousands of times slower than their speed at room temperature.**
